 * This ruleset allows anyone to do anything, regardless of authentication status.
 * This is ONLY suitable for prototyping and should NEVER be deployed to production.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /events/{eventId}: Stores event information.
 * - /registrations/{registrationId}: Stores registration information.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - All read and write operations are permitted for all users.
